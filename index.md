Since the appropriation of the Haitian *zonbi*[^1] into American popular culture, zombie narratives have reflected worries and tensions in American society. In this essay, we will use Critical Discourse Analysis[^2] to unpack the notion of American zombies. Focusing our analysis on popular zombie narratives of the mid-20th century, we find that shifts in the construction of these stories from White Zombie to The Walking Dead reflect the development and popularization of critical race theory and new ideologies concerning agency. Comparing zombie narratives from the 1930s to the 1950s to their more contemporary counterparts of the 2000s to now, we uncover evidence of how acute relationships between zombies and the masters who control them have been traded in for full-scale depictions of viral hordes and contagion. This shift from explicit and concrete control mechanisms to largely implicit and hard-to-pinpoint sources of systemic power, mirrors transformations in our public consciousness concerning racism in the U.S. over the last century. Across multiple forms of today’s media, we observe greater recognition of the interpersonal and covert manifestations of structural and institutional racism. While racism has long been understood by oppressed and marginalized peoples in the U.S. as a complex and structurally supported reinforcing element of White supremacy, we are only now, within the last few decades, enjoying more widespread public discussion acknowledging this fact in greater earnest.
